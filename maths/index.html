            Making a Puzzle Game as a Side-Project : s o l v e o Retrospective

        <div class="caption legend">Original first screen of the game, before I chose its name</div>
        <p>
            As a side project, I wanted to release a game on my own, s o l v e o,
            from the first idea to the actual Google store page.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">I'm thrilled to say that I've done it!</p>
        <p><br>
            Coming from a psychology background, I had zero knowledge of software
            development.
            For my work and personal enjoyment, I decided to learn to code by myself
            and enjoying it quite a lot. But apart from doing quick little projects
            like <a href="https://arthurabia.github.io/calculator/" class="bold link" target="blank">this simple web calculator</a>, I always asked myself if I could make more, like
            an actual app people would use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">So I went on and designed the game using Figma, from the concept to
                the actual game, including UI, localization, the puzzles and the
                hints, really everything!</span>
        </p>
        <img class="illu" src="../assets/maths/Frame_22.jpg"
            alt="Screenshot of the style guide" />
        <div class="caption legend">Style Guide of the game</div>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">I chose to code the game in GDscript, the Godot language.</span> I also got familiar
            in the process with Github and StackOverflow, like, a lot! I
            also distributed the game on the Play Store, designed the logo and
            creative assets with implemented ads as well.
        </p>
        <img class="illu" src="../assets/maths/Frame_21.jpg"
            alt="Screens of the assets used on the store" />
        <div class="caption legend">
            App logo and creative assets for the Google Play Store
        </div>
        <p>
            By far, the coolest about making a game is choosing how it would look
            like! I knew I wanted to make a maths puzzle so after a quick benchmark
            and mood-boarding phase, I've discovered that most games of this genre
            look either very old-fashioned, with good old skeuomorphism going
            rampant or very dark, like <em>matrix</em> kind of dark.
            <span class="bold">So, I wanted to make a game with a flat, eerie and very
                <strong>colored</strong> UI</span>. Something <em>mini-metroesque</em>, if you see what I mean :)
            <br /><br />
            <span class="bold">Also, colors are part of the game, where you have to solve puzzles
                using them</span>. Which is, I think, a big differentiator and brings something new to
            this genre!<br />
            Making the puzzles and the hints were also fun, while very
            time-consuming. <strong>Finding the best rules and the right balance between too
                hard and too easy was laborious</strong>, and even with my limited resources for
            user testing, I am quite certain the global experience could be
            improved. That is one of the things you have to accept!
            What would be nice is having some analytics, and a batch of
            beta-testers, to see where they would get stuck. Then, re-arrange the
            levels in a more &quot;balanced&quot; way. What user testing helped me for, was polishing the UI, the global
            understanding of the screens as well as some puzzles that were
            <strong>not</strong> that intuitive.
        </p>
        <img class="illu" src="../assets/maths/Frame_15.jpg"
            alt="Versions of the UI, several iterations" />
        <div class="caption legend">
            UI wireframes iterations over time, and final design
        </div>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Fixing bugs was a major pain</span>. I hated it, it
            was not fun...At all. <br />Now I can empathize even more with my fellow
            developers! Learning to code, even in GDScript, a language similar to
            python which is relatively easy to learn was quite a challenge, but a
            fun one! All these aspects like saving and loading files, handling
            typography and assets were taken for granted, but now I can make other
            games more easily!<br /><br />
            <span class="bold">Having to make user research without a budget was a challlenge</span>. It is trickier and<span class="highlight">
            if I had more time to allocate to this project, I
            would definitely do more observation</span>, as I do in my day job. But this
            project, was mostly technical, so I am really happy with how it turned
            out.
            Realizing that marketing was SUCH a major point of making a game was
                a good lesson also. Well, I planned to make a game, next time I will on top of that try
            to market it :)
