            Music, Video Games and User Experience : My Masters Thesis

    <div class="content wording">
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            This project started with the opportunity to work on my master thesis
            with Loïc Caroux, at the University Jean Jaurès at Toulouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of his many academic research topics was the study of video games, I
            then asked him to collaborate on a paper on the intersection between HCI
            and gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
            My focus was to work on <strong>the effects of music on user experience and
            performance in video games</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Role</b> : One-man UX Research team, supervised by Loïc Caroux<br />
            <b>Methodology</b> : Secondary Research, Observation, Questionnaire,
            Statistical Analysis<br />
            <b>Tools</b> : Excel<br />
            <b>Time</b> : Approx. 6 months
        </p>
        <h2>Reviewing the literature</h2>
        <p>
            At the time of writing, <span class="bold">there was no real consensus regarding the
                effects and perception of music in the scientific literature</span>. Sometimes described as
            a source of distraction but also as an aesthetic stimulus, the effects
            of music greatly differ depending on the listening context and the
            material presented. This difference is even more evident in the field of
            video games, although the vast majority of studies on this subject are
            focused on only driving games.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I wanted to find new insights regarding different types of games</strong>, mostly
            because I felt this theme was seldom explored, and also for the novelty
            of it! Also, <span class="highlight">I tested different types of music to tweak the level of
                what is called &quot;arousal.&quot;</span> This variable affecting any music, or any
            stimuli in general, covers several aspects, such as its complexity, its
            familiarity, rhythm and so on. A &quot;high-arousal&quot; type of music
            will typically be defined as requiring more cognitive resources to be
            processed and enjoyed, compared to a &quot;low-arousal&quot; type of
            music.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what I wanted to find out was :<br /><br />

            • <span class="bold">What happens when you play a game</span> while listening to a piece of music
            you picked yourself <em>versus</em> one picked by an experimenter? Does
            it change anything and affect on your performance? And on your user
            experience?<br /><br>
            • <span class="bold">Is there a difference</span> between playing video games and listening to
            &quot;high-arousal&quot; music or &quot;low-arousal&quot; music?<br /><br>
            • Do those elements change depending on the type of game played? <span class="bold">Is
                there some kind of &quot;matching&quot; effect</span>, where high-arousal music
            and high-arousal games provide together the best-combined user
            experience?<br /><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Setting up the research plan</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">The songs I used were Distractions from Zero 7 as low-arousal, and
                Attitude from Sepultura as a high-arousal</span>, to stay consistent with
            several studies done on the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">The games I used were World of Goo and Geometry Wars 3</span>. The reason is
            simple: Geometry Wars 3 has a dynamic system, where the environment is
            constantly changing whether you enter input or not, whereas World of Goo
            has a static environment, which only changes when you enter an input.
        </p><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">To recruit participants, I went full guerilla and just asked people
                around my campus to come and play games!</span>
        <p>
            Looking back at it, it was my first attempt at some sort of guerilla
            testing. <span class="bold">Going around the university and picking people was quite
                challenging </span>but I quickly gathered 20 participants in a few hours of
            scouting. Nevertheless, one obvious bias is that I only recruited
            students, which may have impacted the data. That's one thing I would
            change if I had to do it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The test plan was simple: <span class="bold">Users were randomly assigned an order in which
                they played both games in all the conditions</span>. And after each session,
            their performance was recorded (their score in Geometry Wars 3, and their
            time finishing a puzzle in World of Goo), and they filled a short
            enjoyment questionnaire. <span class="highlight">I analyzed the whole data using Excel.</span>

        <h2>Assessing the results</h2>
        <p>
            Results were&quot; interesting&quot;, in the sense that we did not
            <em>exactly</em> find what we expected to find :

        <div class="caption legend">
            Answers to the item “I felt happy while playing” on a 10 point scale (20
            participants)

            alt="Chart showing that self-selected music was better received than expermeinter selected music" />

            Answers to the item “I liked the music while playing” on a 10 point
            scale (20 participants)
        </div>
        <p>
            • Performance was unaffected in all cases, <strong>so music didn't seem to have
                any effect here.</strong><br><br>

            • But! <strong>There was a higher enjoyment expressed with
                self-selected music</strong>, compared to experimenter-picked music.<br><br>

            • Also, <strong>there was some matching between the levels of
                arousal in music and games</strong>, where the high-arousal music provided a
            better experience in the high-arousal game, and vice-versa.<br><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
        <p>
            In the end, what I've gathered from this work, apart from the fact that
            it was, you know, <em>academically</em> <em>required,</em> was that
            there is still a lot of opportunities for academia to focus on video
            games and its effects on user experience. Gaming is definitely one of my
            biggest passion, and <strong>I truly appreciated starting my UX journey on such
                a project</strong>!
