  </div>
  <div class="content wording">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      During my time as a UX Remote Researcher at Testapic ("the french UserTesting"), I carried out 50+
      different quantitative and qualitative studies. In total, <span class="highlight">I analyzed during that year more than 1,500 user feedbacks from recordings of remote unmoderated
        user tests and questionnaires answers.</span> I was able to tackle a lot of
      various UX issues, like helping to redesign the information architecture
      of institutional sites, exploring pain points in several e-commerce
      funnels, or understanding main motivations and differentiators in topics
      such as banking and insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most interesting projects I worked on was <strong>to help redefine
      the advertising experience on one of the biggest real estate and rental
      property website in France</strong>. I enjoyed it specifically because it
      addressed advertising, which has not enough visibility in the UX scope
      in my opinion. It almost seems paradoxical when you know the impact ads
      can have on user experience!

      <b>Role </b>: One-man UX Remote Research team. Supervised by Nicolas Guirao
      (CEO)<br />
      <b>Methodology </b> : Survey, Remote User Testing, Statistical
      Analysis<br />
      <b>Tools </b>: Google Forms, Testapic Internal Tool (Leo), Figma, Marvel,
      Google Sheets<br />
      <b>Time</b> : Approx. 1 month
    </p>
    <h2>Understanding the topic</h2>
    <p>
      Considered by many as a nuisance and by others as a &quot;necessary
      evil&quot;, it is an accepted fact that advertising has a non-negligible
      influence on our digital life. For the most part, the study of
      advertising according to UX is simple: <strong>it is something which is not
      asked nor desired by the user</strong>, it must then be at worst minimized and at
      best non-existent.
    </p><br>
    <p>Simple, right?</p>
    <p>
      But what if, we also consider the stakeholder's needs related to
      business and revenue generation? It becomes obvious that
      <span class="bold">advertising needs to be taken into account into the long-term
        strategy</span>, and that it is in the best interest of users AND business to have the
      best implementation possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two objectives were set for this study:
      <span class="bold">To assess the digital advertising perception in general</span>
      and
      <span class="bold">to evaluate the proposed interface of the website and
        application</span>, in order to gather users feedback and to assist teams in serving
      better ads<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Surveying the panel</h2>
    <p>
      To complete the first objective, <span class="highlight">I sent a questionnaire to 2888 testers
        out of Testapic panel.</span> The results were an excellent basis to start this
      study:

      alt="Chart showing users hated meaningless, confusing and distracting ads" />
    <div class="legend caption">Sentence Completion (127 participants) </div>
    <p>
      All these insights helped me paint a better picture of the advertising
      landscape, and understand that a better effort needed to be put into
      presenting pertinent ads.
    </p>
    <h2>User testing</h2>
    <p>
      After this general introduction, it was then time to get more specific
      and evaluate the interface to:<br />
      • <span class="bold">Evaluate</span> the different types of advertising
      formats and preferences.<br />
      • <span class="bold">Identify</span> the threshold of advertising pressure
      users would tolerate.<br />
      • <span class="bold">Identify</span> user expectations in terms of content
      within the ads.<br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The tests were carried out on Marvel prototypes on the client's website
      and application as well as on a competitor. <span class="highlight">I recruited 120+ participants for this part
        in user tests.</span>
    </p>
    <img class="illu" src="../assets/remoteresearch/Frame_16.jpg"
      alt="Chart showing the user flows from homepage to product page" />
    <div class="caption legend">User tests flow</div>
    <p>
      While testing only one site is interesting in itself,
        <span class="highlight">I always recommend introducing a competitor in the mix </span>to gain some perspective
        and contrast. It is also good for helping
        testers pinpointing patterns they might not have noticed in only one
        product, and to make the best elements stand out more as well as the
        bad ones!
    </p>
    <h2>Assessing and presenting the results</h2>
    <p>
      The results mainly showed that
      <span class="bold">the most popular ads were either the most relevant to the navigation
        context or <em>the best-disguised ones </em></span>. What was interesting was the fact that interactive and
      contextual
      advertisements were most of the time not identified as being ads,
      because of their much better integration in the website. <strong>They seemed
      like <em>part of the content,</em> and users liked that, simply because
      they just don't like ads.</strong><br /><br />
      One of the most important recommendations was based on that fact, to aim
      to show only the most relevant ads, seamlessly integrated to the product
      page with well-thought and clear calls to action, and not just show
      content.
    </p>

      alt="Screenshot of one of the presented pages for testing" />
    <div class="legend caption"> One of the tested pages. Testers had to identify which elements were ads</div>
    </p>
    <img class="illu" src="../assets/remoteresearch/Frame_11.jpg"
      alt="Chart showing that which elements were more perceived as ads" />
    <div class="legend caption"> Product Page Wireframe and Tests Results (127 participants)</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was also the occasion to ask users, with a sentence completion what
      type of content they were expecting to see advertised. <span class="bold">Some of the
        results were surprising, even for the product team</span>, which did not expect
      ads about certain topics such as &quot;craftsmen&quot; or
      &quot;decoration&quot; to be mentioned by testers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding what users expected was a win-win for the company, as they could
      provide more relevant ads and expect more interaction in return (which
      means more revenue!).

    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>
      This study allowed me to venture into an unknown area of user
      experience, and to gather some observations that were useful for the
      product team. On top of the advertising-related insights, <span class="highlight">I delivered
        some guidelines from the website comparison to improve on usability.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the most interesting to me was that <span class="bold">users had real and well-defined
        expectations about advertising</span>, about wanting to be served better and
      more relevant ads, which seemed really counter-intuitive to me before
      that study!
