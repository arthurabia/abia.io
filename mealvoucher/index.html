      Implementing a Dematerialised Meal Voucher: a UX Case Study
    </h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content wording">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      One of the first projects I took in my Lyf Pay Experience, I had to take
      part in integrating a new payment method: the meal voucher, or as we
      French call it: <em>a &quot;ticket restaurant&quot;.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this project was simple:
      <span class="bold"> implement a feature</span> allowing users to pay
      within the app using the meal voucher alone or combined with another
      payment card, depending on their situation.
    </p>
    <p class="legend">
      <b>Role </b>: One-man UX Research team, worked closely to Anne-Laure
      Donzé (Product Owner) &amp; Naama Bassan (Design Lead) <br />
      <b>Methodology </b>: Internal Survey, Wireframe, Prototype, User
      Testing, Guerilla testing <br />
      <b>Tools</b> : Google Forms, Typeform, Figma, Marvel, Notion <br />
      <b>Time </b>: Approx. 4 months<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Understanding the topic</h2>
    <p>
      To understand the context,
      <span class="bold"> we have to know how the meal voucher works</span>
      :<br /><br />
      • First, the meal voucher in this context is a debit card. You can use
      it contactless or with a code, which is provided you via an external
      application,
      <span class="bold">that may or may not have been properly configured</span>. <em>That's pain point
        n°1.</em><br /><br />
      • On this card, you are given a monthly meal allowance, the amount
      depending on your work contract. To know how much money you have left
      each day/month,
      <span class="bold">you have to check on the external application mentioned earlier</span>
      <em>There's pain point n°2.</em><br /><br />
      • You can use this card only to buy food or groceries. As a result, most
      restaurants will accept it, but <em>some</em> supermarkets will as well,
      though <span class="bold">you can't know in advance which ones</span>.
      <em>That's pain point n°3.</em><br /><br />
      • You can use this card for €19 max per day, but
      <span class="bold">it doesn't work on Sundays and bank holidays</span>,
      because you are <em>supposed</em> to use it on your working days.
      <em>And that's pain point n°4.</em><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There are lots of things to consider about this card, so I wanted to
      know from the very start how people used it. So I went away and asked
      people. How?
      <span class="highlight">
        By running a survey on my very own colleagues.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Surveying your own people</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Yes, I did</em> primary research
      <em>on my very own colleagues and not the final users.</em><br />
      Why did I do that?<br />

      Only because
      <span class="highlight">
        I did not ask questions about any interface</span>, but just about <em>the habits</em> of using a product that
      we were
      actually using. So in a way, my colleagues <em>were</em> final users.
      <br />
      That way,
      <span class="bold">I got over 50 answers in less than 2 days</span>, so
      I could start and gather insights straight away. I would definitely do
      it again if given the choice! I had a few hypotheses:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      • People used it <span class="bold">mostly for lunch</span> every day
      but not that much for buying groceries.<br /><br />
      • People
      <span class="bold">didn't use often the external application</span>, so
      they didn't check often their remaining allowance.<br /><br />
      • The meal voucher is not considered as part of the bank account and
      <span class="bold">is not accounted in people's budget as such.</span><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>Here is a summary of what I've found.</p>
    <img class="illu" src="../assets/mealvoucher/Frame_20.jpg"
      alt="Chart showing the card usage" />
    <div class="caption legend">
      Answers about the meal voucher use (48 participants)
    </div>
    <p>
      This data tells us there is a potential pain point in checking this
      information, in which our app could be useful!<br />
      It also shows that
      <span class="bold">payments should be presented differently according to the card used
        to reflect the underyling mental models</span>, as budgeting was not conceptualized the same way for all cards.
      <br />
      With all that in mind, we can start to imagine what would be a pleasant
      experience for Lyf Pay users.
      <span class="highlight"><br />And so, I went on my way, did some quick prototypes and did my
        first user testing session on the topic.</span>

    </p>
    <h2>Going Guerilla</h2>
    <p>
      For this session, I went guerilla mostly because I didn't have a
      complete user flow to test but just a few screens and
      <span class="bold">I needed insights quickly to move on with the project</span>.
    </p>
    <img class="illu" src="../assets/mealvoucher/Frame_24.jpg"
      alt="Photo of the first wireframe" />

      alt="Screenshot of the same screen, in high fidelity" />
    <div class="caption legend">

    </div>
    <p>
      With hindsight, I realize now that I also wanted to try guerilla
      testing, because I was eager to try new methodologies. But isn't it part
      of the job to also try new methodologies while doing research?
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of that, in-house user testing can take 1-2 weeks from planning
      to doing, guerilla can be done in a day. The main drawback was that
      <span class="bold">there was NO way to know if people were users of the meal
        voucher</span>, or if they even knew it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">I got my 5 participants after only one hour of testing, and by the
        time I was done</span>, we already got a lot to improve before the next round of testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guerilla testing is excellent for assessing basic understanding. Even if
      your testers don't know about a concept or feature,
      <span class="bold">they will try to wrap their mind around it </span>and
      can at least make some pretty good educated guesses about something they
      might have heard of. It can, therefore, be useful to use guerilla
      testing if your resources are limited, before a more thorough round of
      user testing with your final users.
    </p>
    <h2>Testing some more</h2>
    <p>
      So, when screens were refined, we got to make the whole user flows, from
      sign up to finish. That is when I did proper recruiting, specifically
      looking for people <strong>using the meal voucher</strong> and
      <strong>not our application</strong>.

      Screen)
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">And after another a few rounds of testing with 12 participants, this
        is what I got:</span><br /><br />
      •
      <span class="bold">Most users could intuitively add their meal voucher in the app</span>, and the info displayed
      was easily understood.<br /><br />
      •
      <span class="bold">The screen payment and the &quot;multi-payment&quot; feature were
        easily understood</span>, but some improvement could be made on the card selector.<br /><br />
      • <span class="bold">Error messages could be improved</span> and sending
      specific notifications could improve the experience.<br /><br />
      • The overall experience was satisfying and
      <span class="bold">participants were eager to try the feature</span>,
      which is always a good sign!

    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, this project was a great experience, in solving the right
      method at the right time of the project and framing questions.
      <span class="bold">It was also very gratifying being involved in the research phase of
        the feature</span>, and to play a part in building the best implementation possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I especially liked was<span class="bold">
        trying different methodologies, starting from the survey to learn
        about mental models we might not have discovered, and design screens
        based on those models</span>. Then, testing prototypes with two different types of user testing
      gave us a better understanding of the context we were going into and
      helped us shape this feature the way it is now.
