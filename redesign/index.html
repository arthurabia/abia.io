    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      This redesign project, which is by far the longest and more interesting
      project I've worked on, is the result of several observations which came
      to the awareness of our product team throughout 2019:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">The current layout of the features was (and still is to some degree)
        a source of confusion for users</span>, particularly regarding the
      information architecture. At that time, the vertical list display
      did not offer an optimal presentation of the different features as
      well. Also, <span class="bold"> the architecture was not “future-proof”</span> and therefore not
      optimal for adding new features. And to finish, <span class="bold">our UI started to feel outdated compared to our
        competitors</span>.
    </p>

      happen.
    </div>
    <p>
      The solution we chose to implement was to redesign our homepage. <span class="highlight">I
        started this project from a UX focus</span>, which needed to take into account two major points : first, the users' needs
      (obviously!), both <span class="bold">the newcomers to guide them
        through the discovery of the app, but also the old-timers</span>, as they
      should not be lost in the transition. <br>
      But also, to take into account the internal insights, <span class="bold">through the feedback of internal
        collaborators
        and stakeholders</span>. <br>In order to get everybody on board on this project with a
      huge impact on several teams, it was mandatory to include them in the
      design process and to benefit from their expertise.
    </p>

    <div class="caption legend">Redesign planification</div>
    <h2>Facilitating the workshops</h2>
    <p>
      The workshops step lasted over 3 months in total. <span class="highlight">In total, I carried the 7 workshops, with
        more than 35 participants from different teams.</span> The
      goal was to use the "6-to-1 methodology" to generate as many ideas as
      possible and identify recurrences of patterns. It is a workshop method, where participants produce 6
      different wireframes, and then merge these 6 wireframes into a
      complete and final version.

    <div class="caption legend">A few of the many wireframes produced during workshops</div>
    <p>
      While sharing with the group, ideas are quickly
      generated and this allows for a very productive way of gathering
      ideas. This is also a very efficient way of seeing which ideas are
      coming back the most often, and notice those who captured the most
      interest!<br>
      The numerous feedbacks allowed us to gather expectations regarding the
      new Home, such as:
    </p>
    <p><br>
      • <span class="bold">A need to categorize the different functionalities.</span><br><br>
      • <span class="bold">A desire for new types of architecture,</span> with two recurrent layouts
      amongst propositions: a deep architecture via menus on the home or a
      flat layout with a direct display of the functions. <br><br>
      • <span class="bold">A better naming of the features, with more contextual wordings</span>, for
      example, naming a feature &quot;Pay in store&quot; instead of
      something more abstract like &quot;Pay&quot;.<br><br>
      • <span class="bold">An addition of new features</span>, like for example a quick action button
      contextual to the users' geolocation.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      From these workshops, we were also able to produce several prototypes.
      <span class="bold">These prototypes were the start of our user tests, and each had
        different variables such as the size and number of illustrations and buttons, or the presence of swiping
        elements.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">This allowed me to assess what were the users' expectations and
        understanding regarding our new homepage</span>, as well as what were their
      preferences in terms of clarity and ease of navigation.
    </p>

    <div class="caption legend">First prototypes</div>
    <h2>User testing</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">I undertook several waves of qualitative iterative sessions with more than 30 participants
        that I recruited via social networks.</span> Some were users of Lyf
      Pay and others were not. The tests lasted for a total of 2 months.
    </p>
    <img class="illu" src="../assets/redesign/Frame_30.jpg"
      alt="4 pictures of me and user testers" />
    <div class="caption legend">Pictures of user tests</div>
    <p>
      The test protocol was relatively simple: <span class="bold">presenting the different
        wireframes for 5 seconds to identify the elements that stand out</span>, the
      testers were invited to give their opinion about the clarity of the
      screens.
    </p>
    <p>

      <span class="highlight">I specifically asked for the clarity of each screen, as it appeared
        that was ultimately the best indicator to determine the effectiveness
        of the interface.</span> Asking &quot;which is the clearest layout to
      you?&quot; may give different results than &quot;which layout do you
      prefer?&quot;. <br>
      Many users have for example declared &quot;<em>that a
        wireframe was visually pleasing, but confusing because it contained
        too much information</em>&quot;or even &quot;<em>than an interface was not beautiful, but clear because
        it seemed more functional</em>&quot;. I prefer to work with the functional one.<br><br>
      <span class="bold">Clarity is, to me, the best north star when building interfaces</span>, you can
      always make something more beautiful and shiny but you can't cheat yourself of an
      information architecture problem, even with the best UI in the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      It has appeared that <span class="bold">users vastly preferred a more functional version,
        with a set of features directly laid out on the Home</span>, compared to a
      version containing prettier illustrations but occupying more visual
      space. They wanted to have access to everything the app offers, rather
      than having to search for it.
    </p>
    <img class="illu" src="../assets/redesign/Frame_32.jpg"
      alt="Results showing that users preferred the shorter layout" />
    <div class="caption legend">Results of the first qualitative user tests</div>
    <p>
      As we progressed, we refined the prototypes more and more. The focus of
      the tests also went slowly from assessing the clarity of the interface,
      with a presentation of screens in standalone, to a more global
      perception of the user flows within the app, and more full-fledged
      prototypes. <span class="highlight">As the scope progressed, I decided to implement quantitative
        tests, involving more and more testers.</span> This was possible with
      unmoderated remote user tests using Testapic, carried out with 100+
      non-users of Lyf Pay.
    </p>
    <p><br>
      Having multiple testing methods, and moving from qualitative to
      quantitative had several advantages in my opinion. <span class="bold">It was cheaper and
        faster to carry small qualitative 1-to-1 sessions at first</span>, before
      asking several dozen people to evaluate prototypes. The first insights
      are then useful to guide the latter test sessions. Having a good grasp
      of the users' understandings, beliefs and perceptions first provides a
      solid basis for design decisions, to ensure that the product is simple
      enough to be understood and still usable.
    </p>
    <h2>Assessing the results</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">After all the tests were done, I was able to validate some hypotheses about the
        layout</span> and to finish the home layout with more
      confidence in our previous choices. <span class="bold">Users could complete our main use
        cases and understood what we showed them</span>, so we were happy! Overall it
      was very conclusive and made it possible to arrive at the version of the
      application currently available.
    </p><br>
    <p><span class="bold">The main changes were a new structure of the Homepage</span>, with three main categories for
      the
      three areas of Lyf Pay: Payment and loyalty cards, peer-to-peer money
      features and new experiences Of shopping, such as our scan &amp; o,
      click &amp; collect...<br>And more to come :)<br><br>
      In addition to this, we rearranged the existing features, to add
      clarity, such as the money request and built a more elaborate and refined iconography, for a more colorful
      experience.

    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>
      As a User Researcher, <span class="highlight">I am thrilled to have led the UX effort of this
        project</span>, which also could not have been possible without the help of
      several other teams. Starting from an initial information architecture
      problem, we managed as a group to offer a new product that worked better, looked better and allowed us to prepare for multiple evolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of this redesign came almost overnight and were quite easy
      to measure, with <span class="bold">an increase of
        40+% of our peer-to-peer functionalities and
        a satisfaction rate of 90+% from a
        questionnaire sent to 1000 of our users.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      This redesign also allowed me to realize <span class="bold">the importance of communication
        and the facilitative aspect of UX</span>. Beyond user interfaces and needs,
      ensuring that the various stakeholders are well integrated into any
      co-design effort is vital. As said earlier, the redesign of an
      application has a considerable impact on several entities, and they all
      have to have a say in the product.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      In the end, this project worked out so well it turned out to become a
      continuous improvement project, of which <span class="bold">you only saw the first part
        today, with a much better, much bigger redesign coming next</span>!<br> Stay tuned :)
